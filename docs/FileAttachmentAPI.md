## DeleteFileAttachment

> DeleteFileAttachment(ctx, id).XOmnismithProjectId(xOmnismithProjectId).Execute()

Delete a file attachment



### Example

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"os"
	openapiclient "github.com/omnismith-sdk/go"
)

func main() {
	id := "018b2f1b-8c1a-75b3-8000-7f0000010000" // string | File attachment UUID to delete
	xOmnismithProjectId := "018b2f1b-7c3a-7d2e-8f1a-2b3c4d5e6f7d" // string | The project this call acts on. A credential proves identity and grants a set of projects; it never selects one, so every tenant-scoped call names its target here. The value must be one of the projects in the credential's `projects` claim and must still be reachable — a project the caller is not a member of, or one that has been deleted, is rejected with 403 rather than silently ignored. A project the caller *is* a member of but which the credential predates is also rejected with 403, carrying the code `stale_project_grant`; that one is answered by refreshing the credential once and retrying, and is the only 403 here worth retrying. Omitting the header is not an error: the caller is simply acting with no project selected, and a tenant-scoped operation then answers 409 `no_project_selected`. Two clients holding the same credential may send different values at the same time. (optional)

	configuration := openapiclient.NewConfiguration()
	apiClient := openapiclient.NewAPIClient(configuration)
	r, err := apiClient.FileAttachmentAPI.DeleteFileAttachment(context.Background(), id).XOmnismithProjectId(xOmnismithProjectId).Execute()
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "Error when calling `FileAttachmentAPI.DeleteFileAttachment``: %v\n", err)
		fmt.Fprintf(os.Stderr, "Full HTTP response: %v\n", r)
	}
}
```

### Path Parameters


Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**ctx** | **context.Context** | context for authentication, logging, cancellation, deadlines, tracing, etc.
**id** | **string** | File attachment UUID to delete | 

### Other Parameters

Other parameters are passed through a pointer to a apiDeleteFileAttachmentRequest struct via the builder pattern


Name | Type | Description  | Notes
------------- | ------------- | ------------- | -------------

 **xOmnismithProjectId** | **string** | The project this call acts on. A credential proves identity and grants a set of projects; it never selects one, so every tenant-scoped call names its target here. The value must be one of the projects in the credential&#39;s &#x60;projects&#x60; claim and must still be reachable — a project the caller is not a member of, or one that has been deleted, is rejected with 403 rather than silently ignored. A project the caller *is* a member of but which the credential predates is also rejected with 403, carrying the code &#x60;stale_project_grant&#x60;; that one is answered by refreshing the credential once and retrying, and is the only 403 here worth retrying. Omitting the header is not an error: the caller is simply acting with no project selected, and a tenant-scoped operation then answers 409 &#x60;no_project_selected&#x60;. Two clients holding the same credential may send different values at the same time. |
