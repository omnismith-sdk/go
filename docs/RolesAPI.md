## CreateRole

> CreateProject201Response CreateRole(ctx).CreateRoleRequest(createRoleRequest).XOmnismithProjectId(xOmnismithProjectId).Execute()

Create a new role



### Example

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"os"
	openapiclient "github.com/omnismith-sdk/go"
)

func main() {
	createRoleRequest := *openapiclient.NewCreateRoleRequest("Custom Editor") // CreateRoleRequest | 
	xOmnismithProjectId := "018b2f1b-7c3a-7d2e-8f1a-2b3c4d5e6f7d" // string | The project this call acts on. A credential proves identity and grants a set of projects; it never selects one, so every tenant-scoped call names its target here. The value must be one of the projects in the credential's `projects` claim and must still be reachable — a project the caller is not a member of, or one that has been deleted, is rejected with 403 rather than silently ignored. A project the caller *is* a member of but which the credential predates is also rejected with 403, carrying the code `stale_project_grant`; that one is answered by refreshing the credential once and retrying, and is the only 403 here worth retrying. Omitting the header is not an error: the caller is simply acting with no project selected, and a tenant-scoped operation then answers 409 `no_project_selected`. Two clients holding the same credential may send different values at the same time. (optional)

	configuration := openapiclient.NewConfiguration()
	apiClient := openapiclient.NewAPIClient(configuration)
	resp, r, err := apiClient.RolesAPI.CreateRole(context.Background()).CreateRoleRequest(createRoleRequest).XOmnismithProjectId(xOmnismithProjectId).Execute()
